This simple addon adds a new "MITRE" tab in your Issue view, where you can add MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques:

![MITRE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04835e13-14d0-4524-9574-ec0768bb38d3)

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a curated knowledge base of real-world cyber adversary behavior, based on threat intelligence and incident reporting. It provides a framework for describing how attackers operate across various stages of an intrusion, helping defenders detect, assess, and mitigate threats effectively. Learn more at [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/#)

The add-on requires [Dradis CE](https://dradis.com/ce/) > 3.0, or [Dradis Pro](https://dradis.com/).

## Install

Add this to your `Gemfile.plugins`:

    gem 'dradis-calculator_mitre'

    bundle install

Restart your Dradis server and you should be good to go.
